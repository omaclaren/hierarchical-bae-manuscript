# Hierarchical BAE Manuscript
A repository to accompany the manuscript "Incorporating Posterior Model Discrepancy into a Hierarchical Framework to Facilitate Out-of-the-Box MCMC Sampling for Geothermal Inverse Problems and Uncertainty Quantification" by Oliver J. Maclaren, Ruanui Nicholson, Elvar K. Bjarkason &amp; Michael J. O'Sullivan.

Running this code requires a working version of (AU)TOUGH2. Only one function, the member function 'simulate' in GeothermalCore calls this, however.
